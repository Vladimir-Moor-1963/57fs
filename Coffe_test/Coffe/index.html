          <p>
            Arabica dominates both Brazil and the world as a whole with about
            85% of the production; robusta accounts for the remaining 30%. In
            Brazil, arabica production is located in the main coffee-growing
            cluster of states led by Rio where arabica is produced almost
            exclusively. Robusta is primarily grown in the northwestern much
            smaller state of Espirito Santo where about 80% of the coffee is
            robusta.

          <p>
            Colombia has a reputation as producing mild, well balanced coffee
            beans.Colombia's average annual coffee production of 11.5 million
            bags is the third total highest in the world, after Brazil and
            Vietnam; though highest in terms of the arabica bean. The beans are
            exported to United States, Germany, France, Japan, and Italy. Most
            coffee is grown in the Colombian coffee growing axis region.

          <h3>India</h3>
          <p>
            Indian coffee, grown mostly in southern India under monsoon rainfall
            conditions, is also termed as Indian monsooned coffee". Its flavor
            is defined as: "At its best similar to the flavor characteristics of
            Pacific coffees, but at its worst bland and uninspiring. The two
            well known species of coffee grown are the Arabica and Robusta.
            Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast
            Asia is S.795.

          <h3>Ethiopia</h3>
          <p>
            Ethiopian beans can be divided into 3 categories: Longberry,
            Shortberry, and Mocha. Longberry varieties consist of the largest
            beans and are often considered of the highest quality in both value
            and flavor. Shortberry varieties are smaller. The Mocha variety is a
            highly prized commodity. Mocha Harars are known for their peaberry
            beans that often have complex chocolate, spice and citrus notes.

          <h3>Kenya</h3>
          <p>
            The acidic soil in highlands of central Kenya, just the right amount
            of sunlight and rainfall provide excellent conditions for growing
            coffee plants. Coffee from Kenya is of the 'Colombia mild' type, and
            is well known for its intense flavor, full body, and pleasant aroma
            with notes of cocoa and high grade coffee from Kenya is one of the
